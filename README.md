# Flipper-Zero-Radio-Scanner

## 📻 Description
Scans frequencies available to the CC1101 and plays them over the speaker so you can hear them.

You can change frequency with ⟵ ⟶, the sensitivity with ↑ ↓, and toggle the volume with ↩
- Does NOT play "FM radio stations" since those frequencies are not available.
